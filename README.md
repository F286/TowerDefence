# Core Framework

This is the Core Framework that has evolved as I have developed Unity apps. Major features include:

- Trigger Action System
- Folder Structure split based on modules of functionality, to allow scaling to multiple apps.
- Unified input system for menus and game, using Unity's built in EventSystems
- Uses as many of Unity's built in solid features as possible, for example UnityEvents.
